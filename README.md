# Background
Dune is a leading global retailer offering clothing, accessories, and electronics to a diverse customer base across 14 countries. With expanding operations and an extensive product catalogue, the company faced challenges in understanding sales patterns and optimizing profitability across markets.

# Problem Statement
Despite consistent sales growth, Dune observed fluctuating profit margins and inconsistent regional performance. Management lacked comprehensive insights into which factors most influenced profitability, customer retention, and product success. The challenge was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights to guide future business decisions.

# Rationale
A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) enables data-driven decision-making by revealing hidden trends, patterns, and anomalies within sales data. This project was designed to uncover which regions, categories, and discount strategies directly influenced profitability, helping Dune refine its operations and marketing strategies.
Project Aim
To perform a detailed EDA on Dune’s previous year’s sales dataset to identify performance drivers, profitability trends, and optimization opportunities across different business dimensions.

# Project Objectives
1.	Clean and prepare the dataset for accurate analysis.
2.	Identify key sales and profit trends across regions and product categories.
3.	Visualize relationships between discounts, sales, and profit.
4.	Detect outliers and anomalies affecting overall performance.
5.	Generate actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

# Methodology
The project followed a structured EDA workflow:
•	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and standardized formats.
•	Descriptive Statistics: Computed summary metrics to understand data distribution.
•	Univariate Analysis: Visualized individual feature distributions (sales, profit, discount, etc.).
•	Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between numerical and categorical variables.
•	Visualization Tools: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for heatmaps, boxplots, and bar charts.
•	Insight Extraction: Identified patterns related to regional performance, product profitability, and customer behavior.

# Insights
•	Certain product categories generated high sales but low profit due to excessive discounting.
•	Regional disparities were evident, with some markets outperforming others consistently.
•	Profitability showed a strong correlation with sales volume and discount strategy.
•	Visualizations helped isolate underperforming regions and product lines, guiding targeted improvement actions.

# Conclusion
The EDA provided Dune’s leadership with a clearer understanding of sales dynamics and profit distribution across its retail network. The insights directly informed decisions around inventory planning, regional strategy, and promotional campaigns enabling the company to move toward data-driven growth and profitability optimization.
